# European offshore wind turbine database

A European offshore wind turbine database for mesoscale modelling of European offshore wind farms is presented, containing all operating wind farms as of commissioning date before 2026-01-27. The approach integrates turbine locations from the OpenStreetMap [1] and EMODnet [2] with metadata on turbine and wind farm properties from additional public sources.

The file is called eww_opendatabase.csv. It contains the wind farm name, the Original Equipment Manufacturer, the position (latitude, longitude, country), rated power, rotor diameter, hub height, turbine type and commissioning date of each turbine within the domain.

The turbine information is augmented with generic thrust and power curves calculated via the pyWake [3] turbine generator [4],[5], which are located within the zip-file power_curves.zip.


## Power curves matching the turbine_types in the database csv file

### Infos
To automatically match the turbine_type in the database and the power curve file, ' ' and '/' in the turbine_types column have to be replaced by '_'

Files were created using [4] with the parameters (and default values for all other parameters):

* ws_cutin  = 4.0
* ws_cutout = 25.0
* turbulence_intensity = 0.05
